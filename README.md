BASALT is a metagenomic workflow for recovering and refining metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) across one or more assemblies. It combines multi-binner candidate generation, within- and between-assembly bin selection, contig-level contamination screening, contig retrieval, and reassembly in one checkpointed pipeline.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **New: [BASALT-Air v1.0.0](https://github.com/PKU-EMBL/BASALT-Air) is now available.** BASALT-Air is the newer Pixi-based implementation for users who need absolute input paths, separate working and output directories, reproducible run manifests, and built-in dependency checks. Its executable is lowercase `basalt`, and its CLI and checkpoints are not interchangeable with the Conda-based BASALT documented in this repository.

The published evaluation reports improved MAG recovery and downstream genome-resolved analyses relative to the tested workflows and datasets. These results define the evidence boundary: performance depends on community complexity, sequencing depth, assembly quality, read type, and the selected parameters. See the [Nature Communications article](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-46539-7) for the complete experimental design.

## What BASALT does

1. **Autobinning.** BASALT runs MetaBAT 2 and SemiBin 2 across parameter settings. The `sensitive` and `more-sensitive` presets add CONCOCT, and `more-sensitive` also adds MaxBin 2.0.
2. **Bin selection.** Candidate bins are compared within each assembly and then across assemblies to reduce redundancy.
3. **Refinement.** A five-model multilayer-perceptron ensemble screens contigs using sequence-composition and coverage-derived features. Read connectivity is then used to retrieve candidate contigs.
4. **Reassembly.** BASALT can reassemble and polish selected bins when the required read types are available.

Optional adapters support MetaBinner (`-e m`), VAMB (`-e v`), and LorBin (`-e l`). Their installation and input requirements are documented separately in the [extra-binner guide](BASALT_Guide/docs/extra-binners.md).

### Candidate-generation presets

| Preset | Candidate generators | Practical trade-off |
|---|---|---|
| `quick` | MetaBAT 2 and SemiBin 2 | Lower compute demand and fewer candidate sets |
| `sensitive` | MetaBAT 2, CONCOCT, and SemiBin 2 | Default balance of candidate diversity and runtime |
| `more-sensitive` | MaxBin 2.0, MetaBAT 2, CONCOCT, and SemiBin 2 | Higher compute and storage demand; not guaranteed to recover more acceptable MAGs |

## Supported input designs

Every run requires at least one assembly and at least one source of read coverage. BASALT accepts the following designs:

| Design | Assembly | Short reads | ONT or PacBio CLR | PacBio HiFi |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Short-read only | required | required | no | no |
| Long-read only | required | no | required | no |
| HiFi only | required | no | no | required |
| Short reads + ONT or CLR | required | required | required | no |
| Short reads + HiFi | required | required | no | required |

Input paths are resolved from the working directory. Use filenames or relative paths without shell metacharacters; for the most reliable execution, place or symlink inputs into a dedicated run directory. Paired-end files within a sample are separated by a comma, and multiple short-read samples are separated by `/`.

For replicate or longitudinal studies, decide the biological strata before assembling or pooling. BASALT can compare sample-specific and matched pooled assemblies, but it cannot infer whether a pool erased a time, treatment, host, or habitat contrast. The [study-design guide](BASALT_Guide/docs/study-design.md) provides concrete layouts and a minimum design manifest.

## Requirements

- Linux x86-64
- Python 3.12
- 8 CPU threads and 128 GB RAM as a practical starting point
- 32 or more threads and 256 GB RAM for larger or more complex datasets
- Sufficient temporary storage for mapping, binning, and reassembly intermediates

Resource use is dataset-dependent. Run a pilot or request more memory for large assemblies, many samples, or `more-sensitive` mode.

## Installation

The Conda-compatible installation below is the maintained route for this repository. [Micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/micromamba-installation.html) is recommended for faster dependency solving and parallel package downloads; current Conda with the libmamba solver is also supported. See the [installation guide](BASALT_Guide/docs/installation.md) for databases, model weights, mainland-China mirrors, verification, and container execution notes.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PKU-EMBL/BASALT.git
cd BASALT

micromamba create -n basalt -f basalt_environment.yml --yes
micromamba run -n basalt bash install.sh
```

Conda users can replace `micromamba create` with `conda env create` and `micromamba run` with `conda run`. [`basalt_environment.yml`](basalt_environment.yml) is the sole environment definition. It uses the portable `conda-forge` and `bioconda` channel names with strict dependency scope; it does not hard-code a site mirror.

For mainland China, the network-aware installer probes TUNA, BFSU, USTC, and upstream endpoints, prefers `micromamba`, applies matching Conda and PyPI mirrors only to the installation subprocess, and leaves `~/.condarc` and pip configuration unchanged:

```bash
python3 BASALT_setup_China_mainland.py \
  --manager micromamba \
  --bootstrap-micromamba \
  --mirror auto
```

Use `--dry-run` to inspect all commands first, `--mirror tuna|bfsu|ustc|upstream` to pin a route, or `--update` to synchronize an existing environment.

Download the trained BASALT models and expose their directory:

```bash
BASALT_models_download.py --source auto --path "$PWD/BASALT_WEIGHT"
export BASALT_WEIGHT="$PWD/BASALT_WEIGHT"
```

Automatic mode downloads concurrently from the official [PKU-EMBL/BASALT_WEIGHT](https://huggingface.co/PKU-EMBL/BASALT_WEIGHT) repository first and falls back to the legacy Figshare archive. A local ZIP, a custom URL, and the documented Baidu Netdisk route are available when either service is unsuitable.

Set the CheckM2 database path if it is not already configured by your environment:

```bash
checkm2 database --download
export CHECKM2DB=/absolute/path/to/CheckM2_database/uniref100.KO.1.dmnd
```

Verify the command and external tools before a production run:

```bash
BASALT --help
command -v checkm2 metabat2 SemiBin2 bowtie2 samtools spades.py
```

## Quick start

Create a clean working directory and link the inputs into it:

```bash
mkdir -p basalt_run
cd basalt_run
ln -s /absolute/path/assembly.fasta .
ln -s /absolute/path/sample_R1.fastq .
ln -s /absolute/path/sample_R2.fastq .
```

Run the full short-read workflow:

```bash
BASALT \
  -a assembly.fasta \
  -s sample_R1.fastq,sample_R2.fastq \
  -t 32 \
  -m 128 \
  --mode new \
  -o study_basalt
```

The final MAGs and final CheckM2 report are written under `study_basalt/`. Intermediate files, `BASALT_command.txt`, `Basalt_log.txt`, and `Basalt_checkpoint.txt` remain in the working directory.

To resume an interrupted run from that same directory:

```bash
BASALT --mode continue
```

Do not combine files from different runs in one working directory. `--mode new` initializes checkpoint state, but it does not provide complete cleanup or provenance isolation.

## Common commands

Short reads across two assemblies and two samples:

```bash
BASALT \
  -a assembly_1.fasta,assembly_2.fasta \
  -s sample_1_R1.fastq,sample_1_R2.fastq/sample_2_R1.fastq,sample_2_R2.fastq \
  -t 64 -m 256 --mode new -o study_basalt
```

Short reads plus ONT or PacBio CLR reads:

```bash
BASALT \
  -a assembly.fasta \
  -s sample_R1.fastq,sample_R2.fastq \
  -l nanopore.fastq \
  -t 64 -m 256 --mode new -o study_basalt
```

PacBio HiFi reads:

```bash
BASALT \
  -a assembly.fasta \
  -hf hifi.fastq \
  -t 32 -m 128 --mode new -o study_basalt
```

Faster candidate generation and refinement:

```bash
BASALT \
  -a assembly.fasta \
  -s sample_R1.fastq,sample_R2.fastq \
  --sensitive quick --refinepara quick \
  -t 32 -m 128 --mode new -o study_basalt
```

See the [command-line reference](BASALT_Guide/docs/usage.md) before using standalone refinement, data feeding, dereplication, or module-specific execution. These routes require intermediate files from a compatible BASALT run.

## Output contract

For the default CheckM2 route, `-o NAME` produces the final directory `NAME/`; without `-o`, the default is `Final_binset/`. A scientifically complete result should contain non-empty bin FASTA files and a matching quality report, while the working directory should retain `BASALT_command.txt`, `Basalt_log.txt`, and `Basalt_checkpoint.txt`.

Directory names such as `BestBinset`, `refined`, or `MAGs` describe workflow state, not publication-ready quality. Apply explicit completeness, contamination, taxonomy, contiguity, read-support, and dereplication criteria. See [Outputs and quality control](BASALT_Guide/docs/output.md).

## Reproducible use

For each analysis, archive:

- the exact BASALT command and BASALT Git commit or release;
- the Conda environment export and versions of external executables;
- CheckM or CheckM2 database identity and quality thresholds;
- input assembly and read checksums;
- `BASALT_command.txt`, `Basalt_log.txt`, and `Basalt_checkpoint.txt`;
- the final quality report and all exclusions applied after BASALT.

The [reporting guide](BASALT_Guide/docs/reproducibility.md) provides a Methods template and a minimum reporting checklist.
