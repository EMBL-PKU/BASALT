:::{admonition} Current release: BASALT v1.2.2
:class: tip

Version 1.2.2 improves environment reproducibility, model downloads, mainland-China installation, and documentation. Read the concise [release notes](release-notes.md#basalt-122) before updating an existing environment or resuming an older analysis.

:::{admonition} New implementation: BASALT-Air v1.0.0
:class: note

[BASALT-Air](https://github.com/PKU-EMBL/BASALT-Air) is now available for new deployments. It uses Pixi, accepts absolute input paths, separates working and output directories, and records a structured run manifest. Read [Choosing BASALT-Air](basalt-air.md) before switching: the executable, sample delimiters, path options, and checkpoints are not interchangeable with this Conda edition.
:::

:::{admonition} Evidence boundary
:class: important

The published study reports improved MAG recovery and downstream genome-resolved analyses relative to the workflows and datasets tested. This is not a guarantee for every community or sequencing design. Dataset complexity, sequencing depth, assembly quality, read type, database choice, and parameter settings can change the outcome.
:::

## Core advantage: coherent multi-assembly refinement

BASALT can jointly evaluate sample-specific assemblies and a biologically matched co-assembly. The former can preserve sample-restricted populations while avoiding some pooling complexity; the latter can increase effective depth for genomes shared across samples. In related longitudinal, spatial, technical, intervention, stage, or environmental-gradient designs, concordant cross-sample coverage changes provide an abundance fingerprint that complements tetranucleotide composition and sequence overlap during candidate selection, dereplication, contig screening, retrieval, and reassembly.

This strategy is most informative when samples share substantial genomic content while retaining biologically meaningful abundance variation. It does not justify pooling unrelated samples or guarantee better MAGs. Use a prespecified pilot to compare individual-only, pooled-only, and combined designs under identical quality criteria. See [Study design patterns](study-design.md) for supported layouts and decision boundaries.

## BASALT framework

```{figure} img/workflow.png
:alt: BASALT framework from multi-assembly candidate generation through bin selection, refinement, retrieval, polishing, and reassembly
:class: basalt-framework
:align: center

The BASALT framework integrates multi-binner candidate generation, within- and cross-assembly selection, model-based contig screening, read-supported retrieval, polishing, and reassembly. See [Pipeline and methods](pipeline.md) for stage-level behaviour and interpretation boundaries.
```

## Method at a glance

| Stage | Function | Main evidence used | Principal boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| Autobinning | Generate candidate bins under several algorithms or parameter settings | Sequence composition and read depth | Candidate diversity depends on the selected preset and optional binners |
| Bin selection | Compare bins within and across assemblies | Bin quality estimates, overlap, composition, and coverage | Dereplication does not establish biological strain identity |
| Refinement | Screen candidate contaminant contigs and retrieve supported contigs | Composition, coverage-derived features, and read connectivity | Predictions depend on the trained models and available coverage signals |
| Reassembly | Reassemble selected bins when compatible reads are present | Reads assigned to individual bins | Reassembly can be skipped or fail for bins with insufficient read support |

The [pipeline page](pipeline.md) separates what the software executes from how results should be interpreted.

## Supported analysis designs

Every run requires one or more assembly FASTA files and at least one read source that can provide coverage information.

| Design | Short reads | ONT or PacBio CLR | PacBio HiFi |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Short-read only | required | no | no |
| Long-read only | no | required | no |
| HiFi only | no | no | required |
| Short reads + ONT or CLR | required | required | no |
| Short reads + HiFi | required | no | required |

Read [Input formats](inputs.md) and [Study design patterns](study-design.md) before combining assemblies or samples. BASALT does not infer which reads belong to which biological sample.

## BASALT and BASALT-Air

This site primarily documents the Conda-based BASALT repository. [BASALT-Air v1.0.0](https://github.com/PKU-EMBL/BASALT-Air) is the newer Pixi-based implementation with absolute-path handling, separate work and output directories, dependency checks, and structured run manifests. See [Choosing BASALT-Air](basalt-air.md) for a concise comparison.

Use the documentation that belongs to the implementation and version you ran. Do not mix BASALT-Air separators or path options into a BASALT command.

## Scope of this documentation

The guide distinguishes three kinds of statement:

- **Executable behaviour**, checked against the current repository.
- **Scientific interpretation**, limited to what the workflow and published evidence support.
- **Operational guidance**, identified as a recommendation when it is not a program requirement.

If documentation and observed behaviour differ, retain the full command, `Basalt_log.txt`, `Basalt_checkpoint.txt`, software versions, and a minimal reproducer. Report the discrepancy through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/PKU-EMBL/BASALT/issues).
